<h2>Society </h2> 
<p>Hybern soldiers wore grey jackets with bone white thread. The jackets had Hybern's coat of arms on their upper right shoulder. <br>

    Hybern had many deposits of faebane, which Hybern regularly used. Their army made great use of faebane in battle, spreading it as a fine mist like chemical gas, lacing the food with powdered faebane to slowly defeat the magic of the one who ate it, tipping their arrows with faebane stones so they could pierce magical shields, and even shackling enemies with faebane shackles to contain them.</p>
    <p>The political power was focused into one king instead of split between several High Lords. The king had a number of Commanders, which included Amarantha, Prince Dagdan, and Princess Brannagh. Two of his elite hunters were the Ravens, a pair of High Fae who would be sent to retrieve things the King wanted.</p>


<h2 id = "plot" class = "biography"> <a href="">Plot</a></h2>
<p>Both Hybern and Prythian are territories where faeries live. During The War, Hybern fought with the faeries against the humans, seeking to keep their slaves. They considered humans their property. After their defeat, they killed every human in their lands rather then free them. They were isolated by other faerie countries and the King of Hybern did not attempt to open new trade routes, letting his people sink into poverty and decay to strengthen their resentment at their conditions. Isolated, growing poorer, with no slaves to do their labor, their anger at the War's outcome grew. Hybern's people came to see the days before the War as a golden era and the centuries since as a dark age, one to be rectified and the Wall broken as soon as possible. <br>

    Around 500 years after the War, Hybern sent Amarantha as an emissary to each court of Prythian, spreading peaceful tidings. She convinced the High Lords to have more communication, sharing of assets, and more trading between each country. Not long after, Amarantha stole the power of the High Lords through trickery and enslaved them to her, becoming the High Queen of Prythian.</p>
