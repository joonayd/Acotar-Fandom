    <h2>Plot</h2>
      <ul>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">By Chapters:
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Chapter 1: We meet Feyre, a hungry young woman, a huntress hunting her prey in the woods near the wall where few dare to go. She hates faeries and at the last moment (her family was hungry for days already) a doe appears but she notices an extremely big wolf watching the doe as well. She lets the wolf kill the doe and she kills him with an ash arrow to his side and fires another into his yellow eye. She skins the wolf and takes doe with her. The conclusion of the chapter in a way is: But this was the forest, and it was winter,</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Chapter 2: She comes home, we meet her family, her two older sisters and her father. They don't do anything and use lame excuses to cover up for their laziness. We learn about their beliefs, we get a few glimpses from their past (mother dead, Elain's kindness, lost fortune). While she does suffer through their ignorance and sneers, she is unsatisfied, she is disappointed in them. And we hear about their drawers ;)</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Chapter 3: The three siblings rush to the local market, where they encounter the so-called "Children of the Blessed"; young people obsessed with the Fae, often becoming annoying to their fellows. With Nesta's hot temper exploding over them, Feyre soon finds herself trying to get away from her. She bargains the prey with a skilled mercenary, who reveals that the wall is about to be torn down. Feyre then takes a moment to reminisce all the events leading to the war between the Fae and mortals, which resulted in their world divided in two. After the woman's warnings and advice, Feyre walks away only to face Isaac Hale, her sexual partner for two years, give or take. She explains that she has little to no feelings for him, seeing him as a means to reduce her anxiety and limit the hardships she daily gets to grapple with, and the other way round. Later that afternoon, Feyre finds the family relaxing over the goods the girls have purchased for their father. It then crosses her that the matter with Thomas Mandrey, Nesta's boyfriend who wishes to wed her, is yet to be settled. As she prepares herself to elaborate on the topic, the front door shuts open and Feyre's sisters start screaming, as a huge beast walks past the doorway.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Chapter 4: Feyre realizes that the huge beast is a Faerie. The Faerie accuses the family of murder. The family confused, says that they didn't kill anyone. Feyre asks the beast who he is referring to and he says a large wolf with a gray coat. Feyre realizes that the wolf he is asking about is the one that she killed earlier in the woods. She asks if the wolf was mistakenly killed what price she had to pay. The beast says that she has to pay the price demanded by the Treaty. The beast then asked who killed the wolf and Feyre admits to it. The beast says that she can either be killed or come to Prythian in his lands. Feyre decides to go to Prythian. Feyre leaves immediately with the beast. Feyre gives her family advice as to what to do when she leaves. As she is leaving, her father tells Feyre never to come back and that she is too good for the family.</li>

    <p>As she dwells on his estate, her feelings for <a href=""> Tamlin</a> transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie and warning she's been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But an ancient, wicked shadow grows over the faerie lands, and <a href=""> Feyre</a> must find a way to stop it . . . or doom Tamlin —and his world—forever.</p>
